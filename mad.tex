\def\q#1{\textit{\underline{Question: }#1}}

\section{A formal model}
\q{Design the simplest formal model where this algorithm can be expressed.}

blablabla

\section{An example}
\q{Illustrate the behavior of the algorithm on a simple but typical example.}

\section{Correctness proof}
\q{Prove correctness of the algorithm in your formal setting.}

\section{Assumptions}
\q{What are the assumptions for the algo to work properly ? what if one releases these assumptions ?}

\section{Added complexity}
\q{What is the extra complexity due to the dropping the FIFO assumption, compared to Chandy-Lamport ?}

\section{FIFO Channels}
\q{Does the algorithm simplify if channels are FIFO ?}

\section{Deadlock or crash handling}
\q{Assuming a deadlock or a crash is detected, how should one resume computations from such a snapshot ?}
